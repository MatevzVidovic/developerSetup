Very important: I want this setup to be as simple as possible. I dont mind if you do not implement some features, just tell me what you didnt implement.


Also very important:
Below are the mac commands which use cmd.
Many of these commands already work on windows when you use ctrl instead.
Keep those commands if they work - otherwise make a new ctrl + key command that does that.
Also, make it so that for all these cases alt + key maps to ctrl + key.






Cmd W to close tabs (browser, terminal, IDE)
Cmd Q to quit application completely (all windows)
Cmd E to quit the applications current window (not all firefox windows, and not just the current tab, but the current window)

winkey+alt+ arrowUp (ctrl arrowUp on mac) to open virtual desktops, and 
winkey+alt+arrowRight/left  (ctrl arrowRight/left on mac) to switch between them
cmd 1/2/3/... to move to tabs in the browser
cmd arrowLeft/right to move in tabs
cmd c, v, z, s, a, x, r, t, n
cmd shift z

I want alt c, z, y, (shift+z)   to directly do copy, undo, redo, and redo, not just to map to ctrl c, z, y (shift+z) - becausee in the terminal, i e.g. dont want alt c to cause sigint.

CapsLock being escape (good for using vim)


on my windows computer I would like to make my numpad numbers and the numpad area operation symbols to actually be: 
1-9: ( { [ ~ / _ = | Â´
/: )
*: }
-: ]
+: @
numpad enter: ^
0: %
numpad comma: & 

I would prefer these symbols would work when numlock is turned off.
But in the past this sisn't work - it only worked when thengs were set up to work when numlock was on.
I am okay with this second option also if the first one doesn't work.

Also, when I hold shift and click the numpad button for:
/ I would like it to be \
( to be <
{ to be >


=================================

Hot corners:
Putting mouse into left bottom corner puts computer to sleep
Putting mouse into right bottom corner just locks it and turns off screen





System important:
- For using virtual desktops: When searching for an app (pressing winkey, typing the app's name and running it), that shouldn't route you to an existing window (possibly in another virtual desktop). Make it just open the app. Or if nothing else, prevent it from switching virtual desktops, so it just "switches to it" in the background and you can then do ctrl n.
- Make winkey space be the default search, just like only pressing winkey.


cmd shift backspace should be like pressing Delete


- Fn arrow up being half of page up, and down being half of PgDn.
e.g. pgDn moves you down in the text so that the new top of screen is exactly where bottom line was previously. But I want it to be exactly half of that, so for the new top line to be the previous middle line.
- Fn arrow left going to start of line, and right to end of line.


In alt-tab disable the split-screen options (doesnt just show you windows you have open, but also combined tilings of certain windows. I dont like the unnecessary mess.)
