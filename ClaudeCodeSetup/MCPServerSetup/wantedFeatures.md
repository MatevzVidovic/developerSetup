MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

If servers need to be run for the MCP setup, I would like that to be done through docker.

I also want very simple instructions for how to make my claude code session then work with these MCP servers and how to set everything up.
If it is possible, I want a script for how to set everything up.
I am on WSL.

 - I want claude code to have web search (if it is not included from the start).
 - How to create custom MCP, and how will Claude Code know when it is useful to call it
 - Zen MCP using OpenRouter and using the google gemini api (as it is free, if i remember correctly) ( https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server)
 - maybe additional websearch integration (like maybe having a cheap fast model search a bunch of pages and get exactly the relevant data)
  - Google Keep MCP
  - GitHub MCP for project planning
  - Atlassian CLI for Jira ticket creation and reading existing tickets

If possible, but not at all necessary, we would also enjoy having these MCP servers set up:
