This all has a problem if you have important untracked files
It worked at 3fs because we had a minimal .env that was easily set up when you did
task setup
where you just pasted in some little string or sth like that

So worktrees cant work if you dont have this clean setup approach
Zou need to do actual copying of the entire dir and then do checkout there.



[branch-name]

Create:

git worktree add ~/[branch-name] -b [branch-name] origin/main
cd ~/[branch-name]
# git push -u origin [branch-name]
# git worktree add ~/[branch-name]-dev -b [branch-name]-dev [branch-name]

Switch to and push and rebase:

cd ~/[branch-name]
git fap
git push --force-with-lease -u origin [branch-name]
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease -u origin [branch-name]





cp -rP ~/gurs-html-report ~/report_dev
cd ~/report_dev
git checkout -b report_dev origin/master




report_dev

Create:

git worktree add ~/report_dev -b report_dev origin/main
cd ~/report_dev
# git push -u origin report_dev
# git worktree add ~/report_dev-dev -b report_dev-dev report_dev

Switch to and push and rebase:

cd ~/report_dev
git fap
git push --force-with-lease -u origin report_dev
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease -u origin report_dev
