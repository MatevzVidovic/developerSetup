Use WSL2 (its just so amazing. Almost like a full fleged OS.)

Make alias for:
cd ~/whatever.../mnt/c/Users/Username
So you can easily come access files from your windows OS.



Cd to this directory.

In aliases and such, you might need to change The "Uporabnik" to your windows user name.

Then:

. setup.sh
