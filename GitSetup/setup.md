  GitLab to GitHub Migration

MR suggestions: marking what code should be replaced with what other code. And then being able to make a batch of those changes and make a commit diretly in the browser.
Thread comments: What still needs to be resolved is nicely apparent and you can go through all of them with one button.
Web IDE: being able to ctrl shift f in the project from some specific commit directly in the web (for seeing how sth worked in the past)
