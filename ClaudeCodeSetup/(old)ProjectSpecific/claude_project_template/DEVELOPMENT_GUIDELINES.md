# Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. Modularity & Independence
- **Self-Contained Modules**: Each module should be independently deployable and testable
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit contracts between modules
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between components
- **Reusability**: Design components to be portable across projects

### 2. Functional Programming Approach
- **Immutability First**: Prefer immutable data structures
- **Pure Functions**: Functions should avoid side effects when possible
- **State Management**: Minimize state, centralize when necessary
- **Composition**: Build complex functionality from simple, composable functions

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Simplicity**: Choose simple solutions over clever ones
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the codebase
- **Documentation**: Document WHY, not just WHAT

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on external systems
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should run in milliseconds
- **Clear Naming**: test_should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]

### Integration Tests
- **API Contracts**: Test all public interfaces
- **Error Scenarios**: Test failure paths and edge cases
- **Performance**: Include basic performance assertions
- **Data Validation**: Verify data integrity across boundaries

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast, isolated tests
├── integration/    # Component interaction tests
├── e2e/           # End-to-end user scenarios
└── fixtures/       # Test data and mocks
```

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Does the code follow SOLID principles?
- [ ] Are functions pure where possible?
- [ ] Is the module self-contained and reusable?
- [ ] Are all edge cases handled?
- [ ] Is the code properly tested?
- [ ] Does it maintain backward compatibility?
- [ ] Are security considerations addressed?

## Performance Guidelines
- Profile before optimizing
- Optimize algorithms before micro-optimizations
- Consider memory usage alongside speed
- Document performance-critical sections

## Security Considerations
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize all outputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular dependency updates
