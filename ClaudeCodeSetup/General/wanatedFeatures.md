  Claude Code Setup & Configuration

- Make Claude commands autoallowed (or create list of autoallowed commands)


- How to add directories for Claude Code to consider (working in worktree)
It says I can do this with --path when running claude code, or do the /open command when using it.
But idk. Idc rn.


Already existing features:

- Have navigation to previous prompts (so i can jump to where the previous prompt was)
Just ctrl F for >

- To be able to copy my prompts and to copy what claude generated, without having the unnecessary | at the start of each line.
Somehow this already works now.
