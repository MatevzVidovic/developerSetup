## Workflows, Virtual desktops and Obsidian are so so important

When you are actually doing work at a job, you will constantly need to switch between tasks. There are constantly blockers on different things, there is coding using agents where there is a bunch of waiting, etc.

You will keep getting lost just in switching tasks. All your energy will go to switching and handling the mess.
You need autistic rigidity of workflows to harness the chaotic mess of ADHD.

You need to limit the number of active tasks at a time (as much as it is possible). But we need more than that.

You NEED consistent workflows. You need them. The same habitual process of doing it that you start doing automatically and become effortless, that you have found to reduce the mess, and that you grow comfortable with.

They might be less efficient then the optimal way multitasking everything.
But the mental effort of keeping track of everything is so hard, you will be exhausted without doing much work.
You will keep forgeting things. Wou will become unable to move on anything. The mess will paralize you.
You need familiar path you can keep walking and you know you will achieve the goal.

### Obsidian

Whenever you are switching a task, starting a task etc. you need to write that into obsidian.
You can alwazs just: cmd + space  obsi and go there and just write things down.

You need to simulate a stack / task scheduler and offload that mental effort by starting to automatically dump into obsidian.
It seems annoying and time wasting, but make it a habit of writing it down well enough so you can always effortlessly pick it up.
After doing it enough times, it will start coming automatically.

Handle them almost like a computer - dumping all context when about to switch task.


### Virtual desktops

Each task should have its own virtual desktop. 
Otherwise you will go insane trying to alt tab and not knowing which terminal is the right one.

Each task usually has: terminal, code, pycharm, firefox, chrome.
When starting up a task, load all 5 into that virtual desktop.

When trying to switch to a certain task, alt tab to vscode in current workspace. Then do cmd + o, and choose the folder of the task (hopefully you have all repos in ~). And you will be thrown to thatvirtual desktop.

You could also have it set, that when cmd space search for some app, you switch to where that app is open.
Then each task could have a random app you tend to use for virtual desktop switching, and you just switch through that.

The workflow rule is:
Only one folder can be open in vscode
And only that same folder can be open in pycharm.
And only terminal tabs relating to this task should be here.
And only browser tabs relating to this task should be here.

Whenever you need to do sth general, go and switch to the basic workspace.
You want to ask chatGPT sth untrelated to the task? You go to the basic workspace.
This seems annoying at first, but it saves so much mental energy down the road.

#### Num of monitors

Generally, I suggest just 1 monitor. There is immediately much more chaos when using 2 monitors.
But there are a few solutions:
- have the workspace be same for both monitors. That is pretty nice.
- have one monitor have just the basic workspace, and the other monitor all the task workspaces. This is still problematic, because it litters your alt-tab. And most messy pointless mental enerrgy spend comes from unclear alt tab.
